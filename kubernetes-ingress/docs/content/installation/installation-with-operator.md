This document describes how to install the F5 NGINX Ingress Controller in your Kubernetes cluster using the
NGINX Ingress Operator.

## Prerequisites

**Note** All documentation should only be used with the latest stable release, indicated on
[the releases page](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/releases) of the GitHub repository.

1. Make sure you have access to the Ingress Controller image:
    - For NGINX Ingress Controller, use the image `nginx/nginx-ingress` from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress).
    - For NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, see [here](/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/pulling-ingress-controller-image)
    for details on how to pull the image from the F5 Docker registry.
    - To pull from the F5 Container registry, configure a docker registry secret using your JWT token from the MyF5 portal
    by following the instructions from [here](/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/using-the-jwt-token-docker-secret).
    - It is also possible to build your own image and push it to your private Docker registry by following the instructions
    from [here](/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/building-ingress-controller-image).
2. Install the NGINX Ingress Operator following the [instructions](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-helm-operator/blob/v2.0.2/docs/installation.md).
3. Create the SecurityContextConstraint as outlined in the ["Getting Started" instructions](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-helm-operator/blob/v2.0.2/README.md#getting-started).

## 1. Create the NginxIngressController manifest

Create a manifest `nginx-ingress-controller.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: charts.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: NginxIngress
metadata:
  name: nginxingress-sample
  namespace: nginx-ingress
spec:
  controller:
    image:
      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      repository: nginx/nginx-ingress
      tag: 3.3.2-ubi
    ingressClass:
      name: nginx
    kind: deployment
    nginxplus: false
    replicaCount: 1
    serviceAccount:
      imagePullSecretName: ""
```

**Note:** For NGINX Plus, change the `image.repository` and `image.tag` values and change `nginxPlus` to `True`.
If required, set the `serviceAccount.imagePullSecretName` to the name of the pre-created docker config secret that
should be associated with the ServiceAccount.

## 2. Create the NginxIngressController

```console
kubectl apply -f nginx-ingress-controller.yaml
```

A new instance of the NGINX Ingress Controller will be deployed by the NGINX Ingress Operator in the `default`
namespace with default parameters.

To configure other parameters of the NginxIngressController resource, check the [documentation](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-helm-operator/blob/v2.0.2/docs/nginx-ingress-controller.md).

**Note:** Some users reported an `OOMkilled` error when they deployed the NGINX Ingress Operator in a large cluster with
multiple namespaces and Kubernetes objects. This is due to the helm operator caching every Kubernetes object in the cluster,
and thus consuming too much system memory. If you encounter this issue, consider setting the operator to only watch one namespace.
If watching multiple namespaces is required in your use case, try manually increasing the memory limit for the operator.
Note that the value might be overwritten after a release update. We are working with the OpenShift team to resolve this issue.
