## Supported NGINX Ingress Controller Versions

We advise users to run the most recent release of the NGINX Ingress Controller, and we issue software updates to the most recent release. We provide technical support for F5 customers who are using the most recent version of the NGINX Ingress Controller, and any version released within two years of the current release.

The 3.0.0 release supports `discovery.k8s.io/v1` API version of EndpointSlice, available from Kubernetes 1.21 onwards.
The 2.4.2 release is compatible with the Kubernetes Ingress v1 API. Therefore Kubernetes 1.19 and later.
The 1.12 release supports the Ingress v1beta1 API and continues to receive security fixes to support those unable to upgrade to Kubernetes 1.19 or later. The v1beta1 Ingress API was deprecated with Kubernetes release 1.19 and removed with the Kubernetes 1.22 release.

## Supported Kubernetes Versions

We explicitly test the NGINX Ingress Controller (NIC) on a range of Kubernetes platforms at each release, and the [release notes](/nginx-ingress-controller/releases) list which platforms were tested. We will provide technical support for the NGINX Ingress Controller (NIC) on any Kubernetes platform that is currently supported by its provider and which passes the [Kubernetes conformance tests](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/).

### Custom Images

You can customize an existing Dockerfile or use it as a reference to create a new one, which is necessary for the following cases:

- Choosing a different base image.
- Installing additional NGINX modules.

## Supported Helm Versions

The Ingress Controller supports installation via Helm 3.0+.

## Recommended Hardware

See the [Sizing guide](https://www.nginx.com/resources/datasheets/nginx-ingress-controller-kubernetes-sizing-guide/) for recommendations.
